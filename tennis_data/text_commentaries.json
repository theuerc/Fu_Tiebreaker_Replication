The plot thickens when Muguruza unleashes a magnificent backhand return winner for three break points, before Williams registers a 10th ace. A big first serve reduces the score 30-40, before another ace saves the third break point. This is brilliant. It gets better - an ace registering 121mph takes Serena to Championship point before Muguruza delivers the most impressive of replies as a forehand is drilled into the corner. The Spaniard then hits one of the biggest returns you'll ever see to reach a fourth break point but she goes agonisingly long with a backhand. An epic rally ends with Serena netting a forehand for a fifth break point for Muguruza, and this time, she takes it with a crunching forehand winner. This is incredible!",

A THIRD forehand error from Murray concedes another set point, but again, he saves, this time with a drive volley. This is an incredible game, and it's Murray's turn to miss out on game point. WOW! Murray's looks to have played the perfect serve-and-volley but Wawrinka stretches to send a backhand passing shot down the line. Fourth set point, but Wawrinka goes long! What an exhausting game, and Murray plays a superb slice backhand on the run to force a volley mistake. Wawrinka frames a backhand after a 17-shot rally, but Wawrinka replies with a return winner. Even I need a sit down after this. DOUBLE FAULT! Murray sends a second serve long and it's another set point to Wawrinka, but it is SAVED, AGAIN! Wawrinka goes wide with the backhand pass. SIXTH SET POINT as Wawrinka rockets a forehand winner into the corner. This time, after a 16-minute game, Wawrinka takes the set after Murray goes long. That was a huge game.",
